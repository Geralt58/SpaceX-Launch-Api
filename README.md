This is a react website which uses the spacex-launch-api to show the list of launches made in the past and upcoming launches in the future.

I have used create-react-app to create the base application and made use of react-router-dom to do the client side routing. The css for each individual component was made using styled-components.

The Website has 4 pages, each individual page showing the lastest, upcoming and past launches, and a page for every individual launch that can be accessed by clicking on any launch card. The website is also responsive and can be viewed on tablets and smartphones.
